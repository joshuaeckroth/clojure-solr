clojure-solr
============

Clojure bindings for `Apache Solr <http://lucene.apache.org/solr/>`_.

Installation
============

To use within a Leiningen project, add the following to your
project.clj file:

::

    [cc.artifice/clojure-solr "1.9.0"]

To build from source, run:

::

    lein deps
    lein jar

Usage
=====

- Basic usage  

  ::
    (with-connection (connect "http://127.0.0.1:8983/solr")
      (add-document! {"id" "testdoc", "name" "A Test Document"})
      (add-documents! [{"id" "testdoc.2", "name" "Another test"}
                                 {"id" "testdoc.3", "name" "a final test"}])
      (commit!)
      (search "test")
      (search "test" :rows 2))

- Advanced Usage
  - Parameters can be passed as a map, that contains Solr parameter names as keywords e.g (start, fields, facet-filters, etc..)

  ::
    Optional keys, passed in a map:
      :method :get or :post (default :get)
      :rows Number of rows to return (default is Solr default: 1000)
      :start Offset into query result at which to start returning rows (default 0)
      :fields Fields to return
      :facet-fields Discrete-valued fields to facet.  Can be a string, keyword, or map containing {:name ... :prefix ...}.
      :facet-queries Vector of facet queries, each encoded in a string or a map of {:name, :value, :formatter}.  :formatter is optional and defaults to the raw query formatter. The result is in the :facet-queries response.
      :facet-date-ranges Date fields to facet as a vector or maps.  Each map contains
      :field Field name
      :tag Optional, for referencing in a pivot facet
      :start Earliest date (as java.util.Date)
      :end Latest date (as java.util.Date)
      :gap Faceting gap, as String, per Solr (+1HOUR, etc)
      :others  Comma-separated string: before,after,between,none,all.  Optional.
      :include Comma-separated string: lower,upper,edge,outer,all.  Optional.
      :hardend Boolean (See Solr doc).  Optional.
      :missing Boolean--return empty buckets if true.  Optional.
      :facet-numeric-ranges Numeric fields to facet, as a vector of maps.  Map fields as for date ranges, but start, end and gap must be numbers.
      :facet-mincount Minimum number of docs in a facet for the bucket to be returned.
      :facet-hier-sep Useful for path hierarchy token faceting.  A regex, such as \\|.
      :facet-filters Solr filter expression on facet values.  Passed as a map in the form: {:name 'facet-name' :value 'facet-value' :formatter (fn [name value] ...) } where :formatter is optional and is used to format the query.
      :facet-pivot-fields Vector of pivots to compute, each a list of facet fields. If a facet is tagged (e.g., {:tag ts} in :facet-date-ranges) then the string should be {!range=ts}other-facet.  Otherwise, use comma separated lists: this-facet,other-facet.

  ::
    (with-connection...
      (search "query" {:rows 10, :start 0 :fields <vector-of-fieldnames> :facet-filters {:name "facet-name" :value "facet-value" :formatter (fn...)}) 
    ;; formatter is optional and used to format the query.

- Optionally use a connection manager 
  - (hint: Use PoolingHttpClientConnectionManager when clojure-solr is used in a web server to query Solr in a multithreaded environment, to avoid creating thousands of dangling CLOSE_WAIT sockets.)

  ::
  (with-connection (connect <url> <connection-manager>)
   ;; connection operations...
  
- Atomically update a document. 
  ::
    doc: can be a document previously fetched from solr or the id of such a document
    unique-key: Name of the attribute that is the document's unique key.
    changes: a vector of maps containg :attribute, :func (:set, :inc, :add) and :value. 
  ::
    (atomically-update! doc \"some-key"\ [{:attribute :client :func :set :value \"some-client-value\"}])
 
- Debug queries
  ::
    trace function: a function to "debug" query
    body: query operation.
  ::
    (with-trace 
    (fn [str] (debug [str]))
    (with-connection...
    (search... )))
 
- More Like this
  ::
    Execute a Solr moreLikeThis (mlt) query.
    id: unique id of doc to match.
    unique-key: Name of key in schema that corresponds to id.                                                           
    similarity-fields: Fields to match against.  Pass as comma-separated list or vector.                                
    params: Map of optional parameters:
      match-include? -- this is not clearly documented.  See Solr manual.
      min-doc-freq -- ignore words that don't occur in at least this many docs.  Default 3.                             
      min-term-freq -- ignore terms that occur fewer times than this in a document. Default 2.
      min-word-len -- minimum word length for matching.  Default 5.
      boost? -- Specifies if query will be boosted by interesting term relevance.  Default true.                        
      max-query-terms -- Maximum number of query terms in a search.  Default 1000.
      max-results -- Maximum number of similar docs returned.  Default 5.                                               
      fields -- fields of docs to return.  Pass as vector or comma-separated list..  Default: unique key + score.       
      method -- Solr Query method
